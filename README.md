**PROJECT DELTA ABSTRACT**

  **IDEA**
Website [goodguyandco](https://www.goodguyandco.com) has got some security features embedded in it. The base level starts with the creation of a Domain, setting up the VM server, adding users, computers, and the webpage and later integrating it to Azure and handling things on both on-premises and the cloud. The access logs, error logs, and application logs of the user are also stored in splunk on regular basis. It can be easily identified in splunk as it creates a record/ log. These are inside threats, and they can be found on the logs.This website handles the security parameters such as password strength detection, user identity, and authentication, Encoding the readable text, and generating a cipher text. In order to generate huge traffic to the website, we are using a shell based script, and splunk will be easier to visualize, analyse and investigate the data in a better way. The ultimate goal of this project is to provide a one-stop solution to all security risks with a simplified interface.
